# HANNA
HANNA is a one of my largest projects. It's a library I've been developing which currently implements

- MLPs: HANNA/MLP.hpp; both `LAYER` and `MLP` classes

using Eigen. I'll port it to any OpenCL3 compatible device using IDT after I get a version out which can be used to professionally train large-scale network efficiently.
